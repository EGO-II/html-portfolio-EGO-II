<h1>A Little About Me</h1>
<p>Started in I.T. in '99 on a helpdesk. Moved through the ranks with various companies to the title of Jr. LAN Administrator. Currently working from home as a Tier 1 Service Desk Analyst, but just know that programming and coding has always been my 1st love. I just had the misfortune to enter the game late, now I'm trying to come-up to the levels needed for serious work!</p>

<p>I'm also an avid guitar-player, cook, an enthusiastic reader of books, a die-hard Linux user and enthusiast, and father to the most amazing son, who also loves computers, musical instruments and food. Definitely a chip off the ol' block!</p>

<p>I have always been intrigued by computers and hardware, I have the ability to tear something down and put it back together, by meticulously removing and replacing parts exactly where they came from. I have also always been mystified by the languages computers speak: C, C++, COBOL, and then the more recent ones like Python, Ruby, and the all mighty JavaScript!</p>

<p>What's next on the horizon for me, is to finish assiting my college-aged son in building his own computer. And to attempt to get my web-development career off the ground.</p>

<p>Feel free to drop me a line at my personal email addres, lets talk! have discussions on all things geek-y and computer related.</p>
